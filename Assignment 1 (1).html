    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Your content should reflect <i>factual, research-based information.</i> Companies that spread <b>false</b> or <b>misleading</b>
         information are vulnerable to backlash from both <small>search engines </small> and <small>soncumers.</small></p>

    <h2>Business Goals</h2>
    <p>Think about the business goals you want to accomplish, and how you plan to use content to do this.</p>
    <h3><u>Your should understand:</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>what type of content format you need.</li>
        <li>what style/tone you want your piece written in.</li>
        <li>what your goals are for each piece.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buyer Perosnal</h2>
    <p>As our guide to creating a buyer personal notes, a buyer perosnal is an abstract depiction of your ideal customer. It is founded upon
         qualitative and quantitative data from market/competitor research and existing customer profiles</p>

    <h2>Search Intent</h2>
    <p>Users often have very different expectations when suing search enginers, and, in its guidelines, Google talks a lot about how to 
        understand what users are looking for when suing different queries. Providing exhaustive answers to user queries increases the chanes 
        of your content being rated as quality.</p>
    <p>Search intent can be broken down into four distinct types:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Informational</b> - <i>the searcher is looking for specific information on a topic.</i></li>
        <li><b>Navigational</b> - <i>the searcher is ooking ofr a specific web page or site.</i></li>
        <li><b>Commercial</b> - the searcher is considering a purchase and wants to investigate their options.</li>
        <li><b>Transactioal</b> - <i>the searcher want to purchase something.</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keyword Research and SEO</h2>
    <p>In order to effectively engage with your audience and outperform your competition's marketing initiatives, it helps to construct a
         comprehensive content strategy plan. This plan refers to how you intend to manage your marketin content (i.e. Where and when you plan
          to publish). Your Content strategy should include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your Content Formats <b> (i.e. social media posts, articles, etc.)</b></li>
        <li>The channels you will publish on <b>(i.e. your business website, social media networks, etc.</b></li>
        <li>How you will manage the content <b> ( who will do the posting and manage the customer engagements)</b></li>
        <li>Content construction <b>(who will actually do the writing? If outsourcing, what firm will you use?)</b></li>
        <li>Content performance<b>(who will analyze how your content is performing and report back to you?)</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Topic Research</h2>
    <p>Take the time to carry out through topic research, so that you can come up with strong, strategic ideas for your content that will
         resonate with your audience and drive results.</p>
